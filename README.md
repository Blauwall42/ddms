# University Project
This repository is part of the university module "Data driven modeling & simulation".

## Milestone 3
### Requirements
- Python (3.11 was used)
- [Covasim](https://docs.idmod.org/projects/covasim/en/latest/index.html#)

### Run
To recreate the simulation runs, you need to execute the  file `m3/main.py`.
For further configuration take a look at that file.

### Results
The time measurements are written to the standard output and the resulting images are saved in 'm3/images'.

## Milestone 4
### Requirements
- Python (3.11 was used)
- [Covasim](https://docs.idmod.org/projects/covasim/en/latest/index.html#)
- pandas
- numpy

### Run
To recreate the results, you need to execute the  file `m4/main.py`.
For further configuration take a look at the file `m4/morris.py`.

### Results
The measure results are printed to the standard output and are also saved in `morris.csv`. Additionally, two plots are created.
